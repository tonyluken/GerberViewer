# GerberViewer

GerberViewer is a demonstration on the usage of [GerberFileReader](https://github.com/tonyluken/GerberFileReader) to read and parse Gerber files. It
provides a GUI for the user to select individual Gerber files to be viewed. In addition it can render near 
photo-realistic images of a PCB design consisting of multiple Gerber X2 files.
